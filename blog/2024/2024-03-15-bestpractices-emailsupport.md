# Best Practices Series - Email Support

Ensuring prompt email support is crucial for achieving a seamless integration. We prioritize addressing inquiries from developers and the community promptly. However, given the volume of emails we receive daily, ranging from straightforward queries to those requiring in-depth research for the best solution or alternative, our response times may vary. Our approach to supporting email inquiries involves several phases:

Upon receipt, emails undergo the following process:

* The developer support team identifies the relevant domain associated with the request, such as Learn, Student, Reach, Finance, etc.
* The support request is then assigned to the most suitable resource available.
* Extensive research is conducted on the issue outlined in the email.
* A comprehensive response is crafted and sent out to address the email.

Below are the recommended best practices to ensure you receive the quickest, most accurate, and highest quality response:

* Ensure a Clear Subject Line:

  * Opt for a descriptive subject line summarizing the issue concisely. We recommend using the following format:
    * {Your Company Name}-{Domain Name}: {Brief Issue Description}
    * Example: YourCompanyName-AnthologyLearn: Issue with Launching Textbook Tool

* Provide Relevant Information:

  * Include all necessary details such as issue specifics, steps to replicate, and relevant test data.
* Be Concise Yet Specific:

  * Offer sufficient information to clarify the problem while avoiding unnecessary details that could potentially confuse the support team.
* One Issue per Email:

  * Focus on one problem per email to streamline communication and ensure adequate attention is given to each issue.
* Maintain a Polite and Professional Tone:

  * Uphold a respectful demeanor in your communication, regardless of any frustrations. Remember, support agents are here to assist you, and a courteous approach can enhance the interaction.
* Follow Up Appropriately:

  * Should you not receive a response within a reasonable timeframe, consider a polite follow-up. However, refrain from overwhelming the support team with numerous emails in quick succession.
