This document outlines the process of setting up and using the Learn REST and LTI Developer AMI. Previously available through the Amazon AWS Marketplace, this AMI is now distributed as a downloadable VMDK file. Developers can upload the VMDK file to their AWS account to create and manage their own AMI instances.

For detailed instructions on converting the VMDK file to an AMI, refer to the [Convert and deploy the VMDK file](/docs/blackboard/sandbox-envs/convert-the-vmdk-file) guide.

## Overview

The AMI allows a developer to spin up a copy of Learn for building applications that use the REST APIs, Proctoring, Ultra Extension Framework (UEF) and/or Learning Tool Interoperability (“LTI”) to integrate with Learn. This image is a standalone copy of the SaaS deployment of Learn that allows development and testing against the Ultra user experience. Once the developer spins up the copy of Learn, it lives in his or her AWS account and the developer has full control over the instance of Learn. All instances are pre-licensed with a developer license. New developer AMIs will be made available as a VMDK file within 90 days of the prior release of a VMDK with the then current version of Blackboard.

:::info Building Block support
**Building Block installation is NOT supported on the AMIs.**

:::

## Before starting

To be able to follow this document and configure your AMI instances, you must have an Amazon AWS account. If you do not have an AWS account you will need to create one.

In addition to this, you also need the VMDK server file provided in our support portal, if you don't have this, please follow this guide to download and convert the file: [Convert and deploy the VMDK file](/docs/blackboard/sandbox-envs/convert-the-vmdk-file)

## Configure your AMI instance

Once the VMDK file has been uploaded and converted into an AMI in your AWS account, the steps to set up an AMI are typically as follows.

- Configure the specific instance
- Spin it up and code!

When configuring the instance, it is completely up to you how you set up the server. We do have the following recommendations.

1. We recommend using the Large Tier instance type. This gives you enough storage and power to run Learn effectively and build your integration. - T2.Large is usually our preferred size (4vCPU and 8GB of RAM)

   > If you see 502 Gateway errors, you may need to increase the size of your AMI.

2. We recommend you adjust the security settings to allow:

   - SSH from your IP only
   - Enable HTTPS access
   - Enable HTTP access (Let's Encrypt requries this)

3. You must configure VPC for the EC2 to properly function. You do this by going to the VPC Console from the AWS Console:
   - Under Services open VPC under Networking and Content Delivery
   - Open Your VPCs
   - select the VPC connected to your EC2 and
   - select Actions => Edit DNS Hostnames —> Change DNS hostnames: to YES

## Developer license and expiration dates

Should you switch to Ultra or have misplaced your license expiration date, you may find it using one of three approaches.

### Using the EC2 Console

In your EC2 console select your EC2 and from the `Actions` dropdown select `Monitor and troubleshoot>Get system log`.

In the displayed system log scroll up until you see something similar to the following:

```

:::warning AMI licenses
Please note that AMI Blackboard licenses are not upgradable. You must download a newer release and migrate any content or tools prior to license expiration. For more information, please review the Migration Cookbook - Recreating Data between AMIs section below.

## Support for Let’s Encrypt SSL Certificates

:::caution Default SSL certificate
The default SSL cert generated on first startup is _**not**_ a trusted certificate. Please follow the instructions below for full SSL support.

:::

Starting with version 3300.6.0 the Learn for REST and LTI Developers AMI supports free Let’s Encrypt SSL Certificates. At this time we do not support alternative SSL certificate processes. Here's a [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/eQu7Ii923DU) of setting up with Let's Encrypt.

> Per the Let’s Encrypt FAQ certificates are valid for only 90 days. In order to update your Let’s Encrypt certificate you must perform a server reboot per below instructions.

### Setup

After starting your AMI there are a few steps to installing and using Let’s Encrypt Certificates. After installing the certificate, management of the Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate is automatic.

1. Register the AWS provided EC2 public IP to your DNS as an A-record. The best practice as an introduction is to use a free DNS service such as https://no-ip.com* to provide the FQDN used for your Learn EC2.

:::warning AWS IP for EC2
When you stop and start an existing EC2 instance, AWS resets the public domain name and IP - you must update your DNS entry to reflect the new IP.
:::

2. Use the EC2 Security controls to open HTTP as an inbound security rule - you should have HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH (from your console IP) enabled at this point.

3. SSH to your EC2 instance and create a file containing your FQDN from https://no-ip.com* and your email address and save on `/home/ubuntu/` with the name `my_ssl_config`. The format of this file is important and should follow the example below. The file contains only two lines specifying the domain and email used to configure the Let’s Encrypt process, e.g.:

```yaml title=my_ssl_config
ssldomain: devmen.hopto.org
sslemail: developers@anthology.com
```

4. Once the file is created, reboot the instance by executing the following command through the SSH session:

```shell
sudo reboot now
```

:::note Disclaimer

\* Anthology Inc does not endorse or recommend specific DNS providers such as NoIp.com for usage. These are mentioned for their free options but any service can be used to map DNS entries
:::

### Create the Let's Encrypt certificate

On reboot, the server will check for the `my_ssl_config` file and generate your Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate based on that information. On future reboots or restarts, the server will check whether the certificate requires renewal, if renewal is required reboot the server to renew the Let’s Encrypt certificate. If your certificate is past expiration, because you ignored the renewal notices, `sudo mv the /etc/letsencrypt` directory to your home directory for safe keeping and reboot.

:::warning Let's Encrypt rate limiting
Let’s Encrypt has a limit of 20 certificate requests on a domain per week. Repeated stop and starts of an AMI using the same domain may exceed the Let’s Encrypt request limit, requiring you to provide a new domain name.
:::

Timing is important. If you attempt to access your EC2 before the Let's Encrypt cert installation is complete you will need to rebuild. If you are having issues, [watch this video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/eQu7Ii923DU) of setup and getting a Let's Encrypt certificate working.

## Access to the web interface

:::tip Startup time

The startup time for your EC2 will vary and may take as long as 15 minutes before you may access the site via your browser. SSH access may be available in 3 minutes or less.

:::

On initial startup the Original Base navigation interface login screen appears, please keep in mind that this navigation is no longer supported and was replaced by the Ultra Base navigation. In the login page you will be able to see the information about the server, including the expiration date of the license. **Keep in mind that AMI licenses cannot be extended**

### Log into the Learn Application on the AMI

The username is `administrator`. The password is the instance ID, e.g., i-234234234234. If you look at the log created when you spin it up it is also printed there. You can find the log from the EC2 console.

## What does the Learn REST and LTI Developer AMI cost?

The Open Innovation Initiative was created to lower the cost of entry for developing software solutions on the Learn platform. This is accomplished by removing the previous Partner program costs and replacing those partner program costs with low hourly AMI usage costs. This enables you the developer to control your costs for prototyping your applications and entering the education software market.

Use of the Developer AMI will result in two charges being made to your account:

1. An AWS Infrastructure charge
   This charge is based on the EC2 instance type selected to run the AMI and varies based on the instance type size and region. An example is $0.0464/hr for a t2.medium instance served from

2. Software charge
   A Software charge of $0.05/hr (US dollars) is added to the AWS infrastructure charge.

:::warning
Not stopping your EC2 when you encounter an error or completed your development cycle will continue to incur EC2 charges, these are charged by AWS and as such, we can't issue refunds on those EC2 instances. Always stop your EC2 if you encounter an error or do not require a 24x7 development instance.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in this space or email us at developers@anthology.com.

## Migration Cookbook - Recreating Data between AMIs

Prior to the expiration of an AMI license (which is not upgradable) if you wish, you may migrate existing Learn data to your new subscription.

Currently, there is no formal migration/transfer tool to port Learn data between AMI (EC2) instances. However, there are several existing administrative tools that can be leveraged to capture the bulk of T&L (teaching/learning data) like courses, users, institutional roles, and enrollments, etc. from an existing (source) EC2 and reinstate/recreate the data onto a (new) EC2. The resources linked below will guide you through this data transfer process:

1. [Bb Learn EC2 Data Transfer.docx](/assets/files/Bb%20Learn%20EC2%20Data%20Transfer.docx): A Word doc outlining a comprehensive step-by-step overview of the migration/transfer process between a source and destination EC2.
2. [EC2 Migration SQL Scripts and Feed Files.zip](/assets/files/EC2%20Migration%20SQL%20Scripts%20and%20Feed%20Files.zip): A zip file containing all the SQL scripts (PostgreSQL format) and example feed files referenced in the Data Transfer overview document (above).

## Troubleshoot your AMI instance

For General Learn System Administration you may visit: [Learn SaaS Deployments](https://help.blackboard.com/learn/Administrator/SaaS)

### 504 Gateway Error

Visiting https:// displays a 504 error in your browser

- Shutdown the instance to stop accumulating charges and try again
- reboot the instance through SSH

### `Invalid Hosts` error

When receiving this error there are two root causes:

1. The server hasn't properly started and the router is still spooling up. Give it 5 to 10 minutes and try again, if the issue persits follow to the next step
2. Incorrect configuration for the VPC. Please verify that the third step of the configuration under [Use the Blackboard REST and LTI Developer AM](/docs/blackboard/sandbox-envs/developer-ami#use-the-blackboard-rest-and-lti-developer-ami) was followed and DNS hostnames is set to **Yes**

if the issue persists, please create a ticket through our Anthology Support Portal or send an email to [developers@anthology.com](mailto:developers@anthology.com)

### CVE from AVG Antivirus

While using the AVG antivirus product on a Windows system (might also affect Linux and MacOS) and attempting to create a course using Learn, AVG may manifest what we believe is a false positive dialog regarding CVE-2014-0286-A. This can occur while using any browser.

The error message is specific to now unsupported versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 through 11. Our security team has indicated that this is an issue with the AVG software. See the AVG website for questions about configuring the AVG software, and for their contact information. -->
