This page explains how to register and manage a REST API or LTI application.

> URLs used in this page such as devcon.blackboard.com, trial.blackboard.com or devone.com are examples. Replace with your own current URLs.

Once you sign into the Developer Portal with a registered account, your applications page says **You don’t have any Applications registered yet**.

![Developer portal first look after sign up](/assets/img/create-rest-or-lti-app-1.png)

You can take two actions:

1. **Register a REST or LTI application.** Select to register a new REST or LTI application. If you already have an application registered, the button’s text is replaced by a **+** to add another application.

2. **LTI Dynamic Registration.** Read more about this topic in 1EdTech's documentation: [https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-dr/v1p0](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-dr/v1p0).

## Register a REST or LTI application

Select **Register a REST or LTI application** to manually register a new REST API or LTI application.

### Manual Registration of a REST API Integration

In the application form, enter your application information. **Fields with a red asterisk (\*) are required.**
![Registering a REST application](/assets/img/create-rest-or-lti-app-3.png)

1. **Application Name.** Enter your application's name.

2. **Description.** Describe your application. Address who your application is intended for and what its main goal is. For example, "Grade Sync allows students and instructors to sync grades with our system and centralize them in the institution's system." Limit 450 characters.

3. **Domain(s).** Enter the domain address(es) you want to use without the http or //. You can enter several domains separated by commas (for example, **devcon.blackboard.com**, **trial.anthology.com**).

4. **Group.** Add the group that this application is to be part of. A default group is added when you create an application. If you want to add your own group, read more about [Groups](/docs/developer-portal/creating-and-managing-groups).

5. **My integration Supports LTI 1.3.** By default, this option is switched off. Turn on if you need your application to support LTI 1.3. Anthology only supports LTI 1.3.

6. **Register Application.** Once all information has been entered, select **Register Application**.

### Manual registration of an LTI integration

To register an LTI integration, enter your application's information in the form as described in [Manual registration of a REST API integration](#manual-registration-of-a-rest-api-integration). Switch **My integreaton supports LTI 1.3** to ON. This enables a second part of the form. Enter information required for the integration to communicate with your application on your end. These fields are explained in [LTI 1.3 Fields](/docs/blackboard/lti/1.3/01-register-an-application.md#information-you-provide).

1. **Login Initiation URL**
2. **Tool Redirect URL(s)**
3. **Tool JWKS URL**
4. **Signing Algorithm**
5. **Custom Parameters**

Once complete, select **Register Application**.

### Register Application

Once you have filled out and submitted the form, add the following information depending on the type of application you are registering.

#### Register REST API application

When you register a REST API application, you see three values that the developer portal returns. **These are shown only once, and Anthology cannot retrieve them. Make sure to document them for your records**:

1. Application Key
2. Secret
3. Application ID

![Registering a REST application](/assets/img/create-rest-or-lti-app-4.png)

Once you record and verify this information, select **Done** to be redirected to **My Applications**.

#### Register an LTI application

When you register a LTI application, you will see seven values that the developer portal returns, **These are shown only once, and Anthology cannot retrieve them. Make sure to document them for your records**:

1. Application Key
2. Secret
3. Application ID
4. Issuer
5. Public Keyset URL
6. Auth token endpoint
7. OIDC auth request endpoint

![Registering an LTI application](/assets/img/create-rest-or-lti-app-5.png)

Once you record and verify this information, select **Done** to be redirected to **My Applications**.

## My Applications

On this application mangagement page, you can view and manage your REST API or LTI applications on your account.

![My Application parts](/assets/img/create-rest-or-lti-app-7.png)

Here you will be able to:

1. **Register a new application manually.** For instructions to register a new application, see [Manual registration of a REST API application](#manual-registration-of-a-rest-api-integration) or [Manual registration of a LTI application](#manual-registration-of-an-lti-integration)

2. **See the name, description, Application ID and group of the application.** This data can be edited, except for Application ID.

3. **Edit your application (General data including LTI endpoints).** This returns you to the manual registration form where you can edit:

   - Application Name
   - Description
   - Domains
   - Login initiation URL
   - Tool redirect URLs
   - Tool JWKS URL
   - Signing Algorithm
   - Custom parameters

- The following data cannot be edited:

  - Data as Issuer
  - Public keyset URL
  - Auth token endpoint
  - OIDC auth request endpoint

4. **Delete your application.** This removes your application. This is a one-way operation and cannot be undone.

5. **Manage your keys.** You can create new keys (keys and secrets), but the application keeps the same application ID. This can be used when you want to rotate your keys or make an old key and secret unusuable. You may never need to create additional keys. When you select **+**, it will generate new values that will be shown only once. Document and store them in a safe place because Anthology is unable to retrieve this data.

6. **Manage your application's placements.** Register a placement (LTI) that is applied whenever a new client adds this placement to their own Blackboard Learn instance and switches it ON. Enter the following data:
   - Placement name
   - Description
   - Type (Course Tool, Course content tool, deep linking content tool, System tool, administrator, ultra extension)
   - Allow student access and/or Launch in new window target link URI
   - Icon URL
   - Custom parameters
     ![registering a new placement](/assets/img/create-rest-or-lti-app-9.png)
7. **Review the schools that have integrated your application.** At the top right of the page, view a list of sites that are registered and using your application. this is how it looks by default:
   ![What schools](/assets/img/create-rest-or-lti-app-10.png)

- This is how it looks like when you have already registered an application:
  ![What schools with a registered school](/assets/img/create-rest-or-lti-app-11.png)

## My Site Registrations

On this tab, can delete the registrations for sites that are no longer using your application. You can also block access to a particular site on a specific group, which makes it default to All groups. You will not see any registrations for a newly registered application.

When a site is registered it will be displayed here and it will look like this:
