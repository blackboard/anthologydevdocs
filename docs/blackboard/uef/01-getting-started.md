The Ultra Extension Framework (UEF for short) is a set of Premium APIs that augment the Ultra experience of Learn with a robust set of capabilities, including telemetry, custom help providers, and UI element rendering - all designed to enable better integrations and richer user experience.

## What features are available

The UEF offers the following capabilities to integrate with the Learn Ultra Experience within its Premium APIs:

- **Telemetry:** Receiving of detailed user navigation behavior data, including click, route, and hover events

- **User Interface Elements:** Ability to populate UI elements and content, including capabilities for banners, modals, and notifications.

- **Help Provider Registration:** Option to override the default behavior of the native help tool in Ultra.

## Want to see how it works?

We gave several partners early access to the UEF during the beta phase, the following videos are examples of how these partners used the UEF to better deliver their integration in Ultra.

### Anthology
