Third, and especially important, should the vendor need to change any details about their Tool, if they own the registration, they can change it in a one-time action on their registration for all clients with negligible impact on our mutual clients. If the vendor has requested the client register the vendor tool, then every client will need to make the changes on the central registration system.

We ask that the vendor talk to us and consider improving their architecture and processes to make our mutual clients work easier on deployment.
