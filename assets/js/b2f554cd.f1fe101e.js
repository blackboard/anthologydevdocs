Our goals in this area are multi-fold, yet all drive toward the best experience possible when Customers license, purchase, or develop integrations for enhancing their Anthology Products as campus differentiators and enablers in achieving their Teaching and Learning objectives for their Staff, Faculty, and Students.\\n\\n## Why is Customer Experience Important?\\n\\nCustomer experience is important for Partners and Anthology Customers for many reasons. Most notably:\\n\\n**Customer Retention**: Providing a positive customer experience can help improve customer retention rates. Customers are more likely to remain loyal to a brand if they have had a positive experience with the company.\\n\\n**Brand Reputation**: A positive customer experience can enhance your company\'s reputation and help build a positive brand image. Word of mouth and online reviews are powerful marketing tools, and customers are more likely to share their positive experiences with others.\\n\\n**Competitive Advantage**: Providing a superior customer experience can set a business apart from its competitors and give it a competitive advantage.\\n\\nOverall, a positive customer experience is essential for building strong customer relationships, increasing customer loyalty, and improving the overall success of a business. This applies to our developer community as well as Anthology.\\n\\nIn addition to the general integration functionality, for which the integration development team is ultimately responsible, the most significant impact on the Customer Experience is installation and support of your integration.\\n\\nInstallation of your integration is often the first experience customers will have with your business and first impressions are lasting and influence future interactions.\\n\\nHow clients discover and know whom to contact for Support is also a significant influencer of impressions of your business.\\n\\nAnthology has built our integration experience and best practices, with these latter two concepts in mind.\\n\\n## Integration Installation\\n\\nAnthology has thought long about how to simplify the integration experience for customers in the world of SaaS. In doing so we arrived at a \\"Register once, deploy everywhere\\" model for Integration developers to deliver theirr solutions. This applies to LTI 1.3 and RESTful integrations alike, and greatly simplifies installation for our mutual customers.\\n\\n### SaaS changed everything...\\n\\nIn prior years you may have built integrations which ran on-prem or in-process alongside the Anthology product. This required customers to manage the software themselves. Under the more modern SaaS model, which is used by Anthology, the customer is no responsible for updating and maintaining the integration, as SaaS product consumers receive updates automatically.\\n\\nTo facilitate the SaaS model, the Anthology Developer Portal provides the means for you the Developer to register your integration once and deploy to multiple customers. Once your integration is registered in the Developer Portal an identifier is issued - this identifier is used by _all customers_ to install your integration.\\n\\nThis means you have one instance of your integration and all customers use that instance. This of course imply some design concepts for your integration.\\n\\nThis model for delivering innovative solutions to customers provides cost savings and improved efficiency for your business. This is because instead of multiple instances (with per instance charges accrued) you only _need_ one instance of your integration which is shared by all your customers. This is the SaaS way.\\n\\n### Integration Design Considerations\\n\\nRegister once and Deploy anywhere means there are some differences in how you design and deliver your integration.\\n\\n> Note: The following pertains to development of integrations which are marketed to multiple customers. Only point 1 is pertinent to those who are developing campus-only solutions.\\n\\n1. **Logs and data**: Integrations should maintain archives of customer logs and any integration specific data as those are not provided by Anthology products.\\n2. **Multi-tenancy**: Integrations should follow a multi-tenant model vs single tenant. Multi-tenant means one integration service delivering your integration to all your customers vs requiring a new intetegration service per customer. This means you have to design into your integration the ability for enabling individual customer accounts, likely only administrator, for any customer specific configuration.\\n3. **Separation of Customer data**: Multi-tenancy means that in addition to running a single service for your customers you are likely using a single database. This dictates a secure separation of customer data using a unique customer identifier prefix on customer-centric data keys.\\n\\nEach of the above enable you to deliver a secure, efficient, and postive experience to customers at a cost savings of single instance vs multiple instance service delivery.\\n\\n### Best Practices\\n\\n#### Developer Portal Accounts\\n\\nThere are really two _types_ of Developer Portal accounts:\\n\\n1. Developer Accounts: the personal accounts which are used for prototyping and testing of your integration. These are in the form of developer*name&#64;domain.tld. These are often referred to as test or development \\\\_groups*. These groups are restricted in the number of request which may be made w/in a 24 hour time period to non-production level settings.\\n2. Production Accounts: these are your accounts used for production release of your integration. Given this account\'s information is what customers see when they install your integration it is considered a best practice to use a mailinglist such as business&#64;, integration_name&#64;, or support&#64;domain.tld. This email must be publicly reachable.\\n3. Production Group: This is a very specific group within your Production Account which contains your integrations. This group receives production level settings.\\n\\nSee <a href=\\"https://docs.anthology.com/docs/developer-portal/community-dev_portal\\" target=\\"_top\\">Getting Started with the Developer Portal</a> for more information.\\n\\n#### Production Integration Release\\n\\nSee our <a href=\\"https://docs.anthology.com/docs/rest-apis/learn/getting-started/rest_apis-learn-getting-started-releasing_integration\\" target=\\"_top\\">Releasing your Integration</a> guide for production release details.\\n\\nAlso see <a href=\\"https://docs.anthology.com/docs/lti/lti-registration-deployment\\" target=\\"_top\\">LTI Registration and Deployment with Learn</a> guide which describes Anthology\'s approach behind releasing LTI 1.3 integrations.\\n\\n#### Customer Facing Documentation\\n\\nIt is the integration developer\'s responsibility to provide the necessary documentation for a successful installation. This is greatly simplified when following our best practices for Register once, deploy anywhere.\\n\\nCurrently there are three things which will generate no end of consternation for customers which degrades their experience with your integration/company. These three things fall into two groups User Roles and Support.\\n\\n##### Integration User Roles: Entitlements vs Privileges\\n\\nAside from it **_not_** being a best practice to ask your customer to register your integration on the Developer Portal on your behalf, even worse is asking them to do so and then ask that they give your integration an Admin Role. _Never, never, never_ ask them to do these terrible things.\\n\\nInstead, develop your integration following the Register once model, and hand off your integration Identifier to your customer. If you are an LTI 1.3 provider - you are done. Your customer adds your LTI integration and sets availability to their users and they are done. No passing around of Keys and Secrets or error prone multiple copy pasting of multiple configuration strings... you hand off one integration Id which you get when you register your integration on the portal and done.\\n\\nWell almost... the current exception (see The Future is Bright(er) below) is if your integration uses our REST APIs. Then your integration documentation must provide Anthology administrators with a list of privileges that need to be added to the user which is associated with your integration. The APIs list entitlements, not privileges, and therein lay a problem for Customers.\\n\\nAs the integration provider you want a great customer experience so you use the <a href=\\"https://docs.anthology.com/docs/rest-apis/learn/admin/rest_apis-learn-admin-rest_and_learn#converting-entitlements-to-gui-privileges\\" target=\\"_top\\"> bookmarklet tool</a> to determine the privileges you include in your documentation to provide guidance to admins installing your integration.\\n\\n## Integration Support\\n\\n### Who is responsible for your integration\'s support?\\n\\nIt probably goes without saying, but the integration vendor is responsible. Not Anthology.\\n\\nWhen the vendor registers in the Developer Portal they provide email information which is seen by customers when they install the integration. That is why this email and contact information must be publicly reachable. That is also why it makes sense to have a specific account from which all your integrations are delivered.\\n\\nSee <a href=\\"https://docs.anthology.com/docs/developer-portal/community-dev_portal\\" target=\\"_top\\">Getting Started with the Dev Portal</a> for information.\\n\\n## The Future is Bright(er)\\n\\n**Forward Looking Statement** applies:\\n\\n> Statements regarding our product development initiatives, including new products and future product upgrades, updates or enhancements represent our current intentions, but may be modified, delayed or abandoned without prior notice and there is no assurance that such offering, upgrades, updates or functionality will become available unless and until they have been made generally available to our customers.\\n\\n### Simplification of Integration Installation\\n\\nTo ensure an optimal customer experience we have a few items which we intend to deliver in 2023. Each of these enable the offset the heavy lift of the installation of any integration from customers to the developer.\\n\\n#### Auto-Install of REST Users with Privileges\\n\\nIntegrations using the REST API require association with a REST integration user who has the necessary system role privileges (never a System Administrator Role!!!).\\n\\nThe REST APIs identify with _entitlements_ while the systems identify with _privileges_. This complicates installation of REST integrations not using Three Legged OAuth (3LO).\\n\\nLate 2023 we intend to release a \\"manifest\\" model for integrations which, amongst other useful data points, identifies the entitlements required by an integration. This manifest will be used on Administrator request to install an integration to display important information about the integration to the Administrator - notably the privileges requested by the integration developer.\\n\\nThe now informed Administrator may choose to install the integration at which time the REST integration user is created with the necessary privileges.\\n\\nNo interaction on the part of the Administrator other than reviewing and accepting the installation!\\n\\n#### LTI and REST share JWT for authN\\n\\nCurrently LTI 1.3 and REST APIs use two separate authentication models. LTI 1.3 uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and REST uses OAuth 2 basic authentication using Key:Secret pairs.\\n\\nLate 2023 the use of JWT will be optional for REST API-based integrations and JWT will be used exclusively for LTI 1.3 integrations which also use our REST APIs.\\n\\nThis greatly simplifies the development of LTI 1.3 integrations which use our REST APIs. The optional use of JWTs for non-LTI integrations provide an improved security model for REST API-based integrations while being backward compatible with existing REST integrations."},{"id":"DevCon-2022-Presentations!","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/DevCon-2022-Presentations!","source":"@site/blog/2022/2022-08-12-DevCon2022.md","title":"DevCon 2022 Presentations!","description":"\x3c!-- ---","date":"2022-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 12, 2022","tags":[{"label":"devcon","permalink":"/blog/tags/devcon"},{"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"label":"recap","permalink":"/blog/tags/recap"},{"label":"2022","permalink":"/blog/tags/2022"}],"readingTime":4.805,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Davey Herrera","title":"Software Engineer, R&D User Experience"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"DevCon-2022-Presentations!","title":"DevCon 2022 Presentations!","authors":[{"name":"Davey Herrera","title":"Software Engineer, R&D User Experience"}],"tags":["devcon","community","recap","2022"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Integration Installation and Customer Experience","permalink":"/blog/Anthology Integrations and Customer Experience"},"nextItem":{"title":"LTI 1.3 tools must generate their own keys and JWKS URL","permalink":"/blog/2021/07/22/2021/LTI 1.3 tools must generate their own keys and JWKS URL"}},"content":"\x3c!-- ---\\nslug: welcome-docusaurus-v2\\nauthors:\\n  - name: Joel Marcey\\n    title: Co-creator of Docusaurus 1\\n    url: https://github.com/JoelMarcey\\n    image_url: https://github.com/JoelMarcey.png\\n  - name: S\xe9bastien Lorber\\n    title: Docusaurus maintainer\\n    url: https://sebastienlorber.com\\n    image_url: https://github.com/slorber.png\\ntags: [hello, docusaurus-v2]\\nimage: https://i.imgur.com/mErPwqL.png\\nhide_table_of_contents: false\\n--- --\x3e\\n\\n\\n# DevCon 2022 Presentations!\\n\\nWe will be adding sessions here as soon as we get the presentations!

Please note this tool is not supported by Blackboard and no warranties of any kind are provided.\\nIn this presentation you will get to know the Bb_rest_helper library, and how to set up with Visual studio code and Jupyter notebooks to make the REST of your life easier\\n\\n#### Description\\n\\nThe Bb Rest Helper includes 5 classes to simpilfy common API operations with Blackboard APIs;\\n\\n1. Get_Config. This class is used to get configuration variables (url,key,secret)from an external configuration file in Json format. If you are authenticating for more than one API (i.e. Learn and Collaborate) you will need separate configuration files (i.e. learn_config.json and collab_config.json).\\n2. Auth_Helper. This class is used to get the token that then will be used in the API calls. Provides different methods for the different APIs.\\n3. Bb_Requests. This class is used to simplify calls to the Blackboard Rest APIs. Provides methods for GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE requests.\\n4. Bb_Utils. A set of convenience functions (Logging, printing...), this will be extended over time.\\n5. Ally_Helper This class is used to simplify interaction with Ally as a service, includes methods to authenticate, upload a file, check processing status and retrieve the feedback. As it is an initial release for this API with limited features, it is implemented as a separate class to provide easier access to these methods rather than having to code them manually or with the Bb_rest_helper library.\\n\\n#### Companion Links\\n\\n- [Javier\'s GitRepo](https://github.com/JgregoriBb/Bb_rest_helper)\\n- [Pypi project link](https://pypi.org/project/Bb-rest-helper/)\\n\\n#### Presentation PDF\\n\\n<object data=\\"/assets/files/devcon2022-bbresthelper.pdf\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"600\\" type=\\"application/pdf\\" ></object>\\n\\n> **Day 2 @ DevCon 2022**\\n\\n### Blackboard Learn REST APIs for Beginners\\n\\n\u23f2 11:40 AM - 12:25 AM Session\\n<br/>\\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb **Presenter:** Davey Herrera\\n\\n#### Presentation PDF\\n\\n<object data=\\"/assets/files/devcon2022-restapi4beginners.pdf\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"600\\" type=\\"application/pdf\\" ></object>\\n\\n#### Video companion\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"600\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fOo04uMcsDA\\" title=\\"Blackboard Learn REST API for beginners\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n### Migrating a B2 to LTI & REST Deep dive\\n\\n\u23f2 1:45 PM - 3:00 PM Session\\n<br/>\\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb **Presenter:** Eric Preston\\n\\n<object data=\\"/assets/files/devcon2022-migratingb2toltiandrest.pdf\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"600\\" type=\\"application/pdf\\" ></object>\\n\\n### Moving to Ultra: A Phased Approach\\n\\n\u23f2 4:15 PM - 5:00 PM Session\\n<br/>\\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb **Presenter:** Michelle Donaldson\\n\\n<object data=\\"/assets/files/devcon2022-moving2ultra-phasedaoproach.pdf\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"600\\" type=\\"application/pdf\\" ></object>\\n\\n> **Day 3 @ DevCon 2022**\\n\\n### Making ultra your own: UEF for Beginners\\n\\n\u23f2 11:30 PM - 12:15 PM Session\\n<br/>\\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb **Presenter:** Chris Filkins\\n\\nFor years, many of us have relied on Building Blocks as a way to add features and functionality into our Blackboard Learn courses. One of the best tools we ever used was the javascript Hacks tool, which leveraged the renderingHook function to allow a system administrator to further modify and customize their Learn environment with custom tools, banner, footers, etc. Unfortunately, the Ultra experience no longer supports the renderingHook function, removing the key mechanism for these customizations.\\n\\nIn order to restore some of these capabilities, Blackboard Learn implemented a new feature set called the Ultra Extension Framework (UEF). This new framework opens a number of doors for developers to once again customize and extend their Blackboard Learn environments after switching to the Ultra experience. The Ultra Extension Framework consists of two key components \u2013 telemetry data for user activity, and injection points to add content at various locations within the Ultra interface.\\n\\nThe telemetry data can include a number of different events, including hover, click, route, as well as portal windows being created and removed. After initially launching as an LTI tool, an UEF tool can subscribe to any number of these events, and typically runs as javascript inside of a hidden iframe within the Ultra interface. From there, the custom script can then submit requests to the Ultra interface to create new panels, banners, notifications, popups, or even a custom help provider.\\n\\nThe attached presentation will provide some sample code snippets from projects that we have deployed in our production environment, including banners and custom help providers.\\n\\n<object data=\\"/assets/files/devcon2022-makingultrayourown.pdf\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"600\\" type=\\"application/pdf\\" ></object>\\n\\n### Best Practices for Building Your LTI Advantage & REST Applications For Learn, From Registration through Release\\n\\n\u23f2 9:00 AM - 9:45 PM Session\\n<br/>\\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb **Presenter:** Mark Kauffman\\n\\nIn this session Mark will give best practices for integrations that use LTI 1.3 and/or the Blackboard Learn REST APIs.

The tool vendor was then responsible for copying and storing those values on their side.\\n\\nBut the [IMS Global](https://imsglobal.org) community has moved away from that model and now suggests that tool vendors generate their own key pairs for LTI authentication and provide their public key via a [JWKS URL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517).\u202fThis model is more secure because there is not copying of a private key and allows the LTI Tool provider to follow best practices with key rotation.\\n\\nWe decided to follow that suggestion. If you want to register a new tool with Learn, you have to provide the JWKS URL information. And if you have an existing tool that use the Anthology-generated private key, please keep in mind that we\'ll be terminating support in the near future.\\n\\nNOTE: Once you\'ve made the change, you must have our mutual clients redeploy your LTI 1.3 tool. Redeploy means the following: \\n1. Admin -> Integrations, LTI Tool Providers -> Register LTI 1.3/Advantage Tool\\n2. Enter the same client ID for your tool that was previously deployed. Click the [Submit] Button.\\n3. Your tool will be redeployed to use your new JWKS URL.  \\n\\nFollow the above steps exactly. Do NOT have them delete the integration as that will destroy all existing links to your tool, which can not be recovered.\\n\\n[Here is a video explanation](https://youtu.be/M_d8-G-hGlI) of both the steps you need to take to update your tool\'s JWKS URL and the step you will need to have our mutual clients take. Note that after you update your tool\'s JWKS URL on the developer portal our mutual clients will NOT able to use your product until after they redeploy as described above and in the video.\\n\\nFAQ:\\n\\n1. Is this just a background change, and it will not impact anything on the front end?  \\n-> There is no impact to how our mutual clients use the LTI Tool or Learn.\\n2. Does making the change at the central location serve the purpose, or are we required to plan anything around individual connections for separate schools?  \\n-> You will need to work with the individual schools to ensure that after you make the chage they redploy your tool as described above.\\n3. Will schools transition seamlessly once we transition from a static public key to keyset URL (JWKS), or does it require any intervention from the Black side or the school admins?  \\n-> The school admins will need to redeploy your tool as described above.\\n4. Currently, both static public key and keyset URL (JWKS) are going through successfully. Is it because Anthology hasn\u2019t yet discontinued supporting the static public key?  \\n-> Anthology will continue supporting the keys that were originally provided until further notice, likely until the end of 2022*.\\n\\nAs always, if you have any questions, check out the [contact us page](https://docs.anthology.com/docs/Community/community-contact_us) and let us know!\\n\\n*Statements regarding our product development initiatives, including new products and future product upgrades, updates or enhancements represent our current intentions, but may be modified, delayed or abandoned without prior notice and there is no assurance that such offering, upgrades, updates or functionality will become available unless and until they have been made generally available to our customers."},{"id":"/2021/05/10/2021/use one time session tokens instead of cookies for UEF authentication","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/05/10/2021/use one time session tokens instead of cookies for UEF authentication","source":"@site/blog/2021/2021-05-10-use one time session tokens instead of cookies for UEF authentication.md","title":"Use One-Time Session Token to Authenticate with UEF","description":"In testing with the Google Canary Chrome Browser, one of our clients discovered an issue that was blocking users from logging in to their Learn instance.

After much troubleshooting, we discovered a multi-layer issue that brings us to, you guessed it, [cookies](https://docs.anthology.com/blog/2020/10/15/Cookies-and-Browsers).\\n\\n> **This affects clients in SaaS with Ultra Base Navigation enabled using Ultra integrations that rely on UEF**\\n\\nHere is a brief description of the contributing factors:\\n\\nFirst, the client had built a custom Ultra login page. The page included code designed to ensure that Learn login pages would never render inside of an iframe within Learn. It looks like this:\\n\\n```\\nif\xa0(\xa0top\xa0!=\xa0self\xa0)\\n{\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0top.location.replace(\xa0self.location.href\xa0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn and of itself there\'s nothing wrong with it. We, at Anthology, have removed it from the default Ultra login page, but many clients use it in Original login pages, and so it\'s moved with them into Ultra.\\n\\n> If you are unsure whether you have a custom login page, visit [help.blackboard.com](https://help.blackboard.com/learn/Administrator/SaaS/User_Interface_Options/Ultra_Experience/Institution_Branding/Customize_the_Login_Page) for more information.\\n\\nSecondly, when a user logged in, Ultra Extensions automatically fired off an LTI launch to UEF-enabled tools. The way UEF works is: after the LTI launch is validated, the tool redirects to the Learn REST endpoint to initiate a UserAuth flow. In our documentation, we call this a Three-Legged OAuth or [3LO](https://docs.anthology.com/docs/rest-apis/learn/getting-started/rest_apis-learn-getting-started-3lo). In most cases, it\'s a process that relies on a session cookie to hold everything together. This impending release of Chrome (and other browsers) will block this cookie because everything is happening across domains and involves the use of iframes.\\n\\nSo what happens is that, even though the integration is configured in Learn to not force the end-user to authorize the integration, the lack of the session cookie means that Learn has no idea that this user is logged in, so it pops open the login page.\\n\\nRemember that code snippet above in the custom login page? Well, that takes over the entire browser page with the Learn login. And when the user logs in again, it renders the JavaScript meant for the UEF iframe into the page. In other words, it overtakes your Learn browser session. There is no way to actually get past that screen.\\n\\nRelated, this same issue affects Safari users when [cross-site tracking is disabled](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/prevent-cross-site-tracking-sfri40732/mac).\\n\\n## So what can you do?\\n\\nWell, that depends upon who is reading this blog. If you are an administrator trying to get your users back in Learn, the most immediate fix is to remove that snippet from your login page. It won\'t fix your broken UEF integration, but it will at least let your users log in and interact with Learn.\\n\\nIf you are a developer that has built a UEF integration, we actually implemented a fix for this in April: a way to bypass the need for a session cookie in this process. In the LTI launch, we now provide what is called a\xa0one-time session cookie. This is present in both LTI 1.1 and 1.3 launches.\\n\\nIf you are using LTI 1.3, there\'s a small bug in this. I will share a workaround that will both get around this bug, but not fail when the bug is fixed.\\n\\nThis one-time session cookie is added to the claims in the LTI 1.3 JWT and the form POST parameters in LTI 1.1. You can grab that value from the LTI launch, return it as a parameter in your 3LO authorization code request, and your problem will be solved.\\n\\n### LTI\xa01.3\\n\\nIn LTI 1.3, you will see the value in the `https://blackboard.com/lti/claim/one_time_session_token` claim. This token is made up of a specially generated token value. It should also be followed by a comma and the user\'s UUID. The bug is that the comma is missing. Luckily, the user\'s UUID is the sub token in the same set of LTI claims. We intend to fix this, but to ensure your code works both now and after the fix, you can simply look for the comma. If it\'s not there, append it and the sub and you will be off and running. Here\'s a Python 3 code snippet to illustrate how this might look. We will be updating our UEF sample code, but at the time of this writing, we have not done so.\\n\\n```\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0#\xa0Get\xa0the\xa0value\xa0of\xa0the\xa0one\xa0time\xa0session\xa0token\xa0from\xa0the\xa0LTI\xa0claim\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0one_time_session_token\xa0\xa0=\xa0message_launch_data[\'https://blackboard.com/lti/claim/one_time_session_token\']\\n\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0#\xa0If\xa0there\xa0is\xa0no\xa0comma\xa0in\xa0the\xa0value,\xa0we\'ve\xa0hit\xa0the\xa0bug.\xa0Add\xa0it\xa0and\xa0the\xa0user\'s\xa0UUID\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0if\xa0\\",\\"\xa0not\xa0in\xa0one_time_session_token:\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0one_time_session_token\xa0+=\xa0\\",\\"\xa0+\xa0message_launch_data[\'sub\']\\n\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0#\xa0Add\xa0the\xa0one_time_session_token\xa0to\xa0the\xa0query\xa0parameters\xa0to\xa0send\xa0to\xa0the\xa0Authorization\xa0Code\xa0endpoint\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0params\xa0=\xa0{\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\'redirect_uri\'\xa0:\xa0Config.config[\'app_url\']\xa0+\xa0\'/authcode/\',\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\'response_type\'\xa0:\xa0\'code\',\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\'client_id\'\xa0:\xa0Config.config[\'learn_rest_key\'],\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\'one_time_session_token\'\xa0:\xa0one_time_session_token,\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\'scope\'\xa0:\xa0\'*\',\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\'state\'\xa0:\xa0str(uuid.uuid4())\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0}\\n\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0#\xa0Encode\xa0the\xa0parameters\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0encoded_params\xa0=\xa0urllib.parse.urlencode(params)\\n\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0#\xa0Redirect\xa0the\xa0successful\xa0LTI\xa0validation\xa0to\xa0the\xa0Authorization\xa0Code\xa0endpoint\\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0return(redirect(learn_url\xa0+\xa0\'/learn/api/public/v1/oauth2/authorizationCode?\'\xa0+\xa0encoded_params))\\n```\\n\\n### LTI\xa01.1\\n\\nBy now, I hope you are using LTI 1.3, but I know many are not. As a result, we also added a one-time session token to LTI 1.1 launches. This will come in the form POST parameter `ext_one_time_session_token`. Just like in the 1.3 example, your application should take this value from the LTI launch, append it to the authorization code request endpoint as `one_time_session_token=that_token` and redirect them to the authorization code endpoint.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nWe have validated this fix with one of the partners that was affected. If you are a developer, please fix the issue immediately! If you are an administrator of a Learn SaaS instance using Ultra, and you have UEF integrations, make sure you do not have that JavaScript snippet on your login page. And if you do, please remove it. Then let your UEF integration partners and developers know that this fix must be made as soon as possible.\\n\\nRegardless of whether you are an administrator or a developer, please feel free to reach out to us at\xa0developers@anthology.com\xa0with any questions.\\n\\nHappy coding!"},{"id":"/2021/01/06/2021/How to Create a User With Limited Entitlements For REST API Calls","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/01/06/2021/How to Create a User With Limited Entitlements For REST API Calls","source":"@site/blog/2021/2021-01-06-How to Create a User With Limited Entitlements For REST API Calls.md","title":"How to Create a User With Limited Entitlements For REST API Calls","description":"First, as our documentation states, a Learn admin should never be told to associate a user with Learn admin privileges with any REST API integration, see this document.

Safari has disallowed this for years as a user privacy measure.\\n\\nAnother case where cookies aren\u2019t being sent back is during a form POST back to your application. If you set a cookie, then launch to a 3rd party application, if that application does a form POST back to you, the browser will likely not send your cookie back because it is trying to help prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.\\n\\nRather than detail all the scenarios and work arounds here I link to two web pages that are immensely helpful in explaining the situation and some possible workarounds.\\n\\nThe TL;DR is if you must set a cookie in your web application, be careful how you configure that cookie\u2019s properties, and understand that at least in Safari, your cookies may not get passed back to you. The other browser makers are going to get as restrictive as Safari soon.\\n\\n- [Samesite Cookies Explained](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/)\\n- [Samesite Cookie Recipes](https://web.dev/samesite-cookie-recipes/)"},{"id":"/2020/10/07/2020/New-Student-Id-Template-Variable","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/10/07/2020/New-Student-Id-Template-Variable","source":"@site/blog/2020/2020-10-07-New-Student-Id-Template-Variable.md","title":"Student Id Template Variable","description":"New in SaaS and the forthcoming 3900 release\\\\* an @X@user.studentid@X@ template variable!.","date":"2020-10-07T08:40:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 7, 2020","tags":[{"label":"learn","permalink":"/blog/tags/learn"},{"label":"template-variables","permalink":"/blog/tags/template-variables"}],"readingTime":0.355,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Kauffman"}],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Student Id Template Variable","date":"2020-10-07 08:40","category":"blog","author":"Mark Kauffman","post_id":"2020-10-07-student_id_template_variable","tags":["learn","template-variables"],"summary":"New in SaaS and the forthcoming 3900 release an @X@user.student_id@X@ template variable!"},"prevItem":{"title":"Cookies and Browsers","permalink":"/blog/2020/10/15/2020/Cookies-and-Browsers"},"nextItem":{"title":"Oct 2020 - Changes that will impact Learn B2 Integrations","permalink":"/blog/2020/10/04/2020/Changes-That-Impact-Learn-B2-Integrations"}},"content":"New in SaaS and the forthcoming 3900 release\\\\* [an @X@user.student_id@X@ template variable!](https://docs.anthology.com/docs/rest-apis/learn/advanced/rest_apis-learn-advanced-dynamic_rendering).\\n\\n- Statements regarding our product development initiatives, including new products and future product upgrades, updates or enhancements represent our current intentions, but may be modified, delayed or abandoned without prior notice and there is no assurance that such offering, upgrades, updates or functionality will become available unless and until they have been made generally available to our customers.\\n\\n-markk"},{"id":"/2020/10/04/2020/Changes-That-Impact-Learn-B2-Integrations","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2020/10/04/2020/Changes-That-Impact-Learn-B2-Integrations","source":"@site/blog/2020/2020-10-04-Changes-That-Impact-Learn-B2-Integrations.md","title":"Oct 2020 - Changes that will impact Learn B2 Integrations","description":"Read this article .

In its initial form, you are able to upload files, process them through Ally\'s accessibility checklist, and retrieve data that tells you what can be improved. This is only the tip of the iceberg, so make sure you continue to monitor this amazing capability for enhancements moving forward. For more information, including a conversation about pricing, reach out to your Account Executive.\\n\\nThe Ultra Extension Framework Premium APIs allow an integration to subscribe to events happening real-time in the Ultra UI, and respond to those events by interacting directly with the UI to do things like open panels, display modals, show messages and notifications, and augment the help system in Learn. Partners will need to be at a bronze level or higher to access these Premium APIs. See the partnership team for more information. If you are not a partner, check out [how to become a partner](https://docs.anthology.com/docs/partners/become-a-partner). Licensed clients need only request access. Access is granted to your group in the developer portal, much like rate limits.

This blog will start a weekly series in which everything Thursday, we will talk about DevCon from a content perspective. To begin this series, I want to set some context about the scope of this conference, so you, the reader, will have a baseline to base your opinions from.\\n\\nSo let\'s start with some basic figures:\\n\\n- Client Registrations: 3,113\u200b\\n- Institutions: 1,276\u200b\\n- Countries: 54\u200b\\n- Badges: 2,348\u200b\\n- 358 Unique attendees to live sessions\u200b\\n- 2,352 Attendees to live sessions total\u200b\\n- 121,842 Collab session minutes\\n- Blackboarders: 300\u200b\\n\\nIf we really look at this, we can come up with some interesting insights.\\n\\nIf we base our calculations on unique attendees to live sessions, we can see that the average attendee spent almost 6 hours actively engaged in sessions. We had 71 hours worth of sessions spread out over three separate time zones -- Monday - Friday 8am-10am EDT, Monday - Friday 1pm-3pm EDT and on five days, 3pm to 4pm, and Monday-Thursday 8pm-10pm EDT -- so the average attendee joining 6 sessions is pretty amazing.\\n\\nWe also issued 6.6 badges per active attendee programmatically through Badgr. These badges included attending at least 75% of a collab session associated with a session, pathways, which awarded badges based on predetermined groups of session badges, interaction with Ally, and earning points and promotions in the leaderboard.\\n\\nSpeaking of insights, let\'s take a look at a few that show how users interacted with the content provided:\\n\\n![Attendance by Session and Region](/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-1.png \\"Attendance by Session and Region\\")\\n\\n![Registration by Country](/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-2.png \\"Registration by Country\\")\\n\\n![Collaborate Minutes By Day](/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-3.png \\"Collaborate Minutes By Day\\")\\n\\n![Recording Views and Downloads](/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-4.png \\"Recording Views and Downloads\\")\\n\\n![Final Leaderboard](/assets/img/blogs-devcon-numbers-5.png \\"Final Leaderboard\\")\\n\\nNumbers and charts are cool, but what really matters from a DevCon perspective, is the experience of the attendees. Here are a few quotes that I think sum up the DevCon 2020 experience more that any statistic or chart can:\\n\\n> \u201cSUPER big high-five / cheers / shout-out and ALL the other superlatives out to @Scott Hurrey and all that helped make this 2020 DevCon !!!! have greatly enjoyed it in this time of Social Distancing\u201d\u200b\\n\\n- Kevin Squire, PA Virtual Charter School\\n\\n> \u201cThanks @shurrey Scott for an awesome experience.. and thank you to all the presenters as well as participants. Look forward to continue networking and finding better solutions for students and faculty.\u201d\u200b\\n\\n- Arokia Raj, INTI International Universities and Colleges, Malaysia\\n\\n> \u201cA big thank you to @shurrey and colleagues from @Blackboard for making the 2020 #DevCon a really special online experience. Spreading the event out over a fortnight gave participants a chance to practice and play, not just listen. Fun in dark times.\u201d\u200b\\n\\n- Malcolm Murray, Durham\\n\\nTo summarize, DevCon 2020 was a unique experience, and one that gave me a little bit of normalcy. Of course I would rather see everyone in person, but since I can\'t, I was extremely happy we could have a virtual get-together.\\n\\nHappy Coding!\\n-scott"},{"id":"20200710-inorbitatdevcon2020","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/20200710-inorbitatdevcon2020","source":"@site/blog/2020/2020-07-10-In Orbit at DevCon 2020.md","title":"In Orbit at DevCon 2020","description":"DevCon 2020 kicked off in full force this week with clients, partners and Blackboarders around the world coming together in Learn Ultra to network, share knowledge, and dig deeper into Blackboard tech.","date":"2020-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 10, 2020","tags":[{"label":"devcon","permalink":"/blog/tags/devcon"},{"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"label":"recap","permalink":"/blog/tags/recap"}],"readingTime":3.66,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Scott Hurrey"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"In Orbit at DevCon 2020","date":"2020/07/10","author":"Scott Hurrey","slug":"20200710-inorbitatdevcon2020","category":"blog","tags":["devcon","community","recap"],"summary":"DevCon 2020 kicked off in full force this week with clients, partners and Blackboarders around the world coming together in Learn Ultra to network, share knowledge, and dig deeper into Blackboard tech."},"prevItem":{"title":"DevCon 2020 By The Numbers","permalink":"/blog/2020/08/03/2020/DevCon-2020-by-the-numbers"}},"content":"DevCon 2020 kicked off in full force this week with clients, partners and Blackboarders around the world coming together in Learn Ultra to network, share knowledge, and dig deeper into Blackboard tech.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve had a record number of people at DevCon with 2,273 attendees logging in from 973 institutions and 43 countries throughout the week. We also had some amazing content, delivered all over the world.\\n\\nOur most-attended session was \'Collaborate Best Practices\' presented by Amy Eyre from the University of York and Helga Gunnarsdottir from the University of the West of England (UWE), co-chairs of the EMEA Mobile and Collaborate User Group, affectionately known as [MoCo](https://community.blackboard.com/groups/home/57).\\n\\nOther highlights include the \'May the Data be with you\' series. I definitly miss seeing everyone in person, so the lively interaction in these sessions led by a talented group of System Administrators was definitely the next best thing. Big thanks to Casey Eubank from WSU Tech, Chris Bray from Arkansas, Heather Crites from Columbia State Community College, Dan Gioia from St. Louis Community College, Bradley Lawton from Louisville, and Mark Reynolds from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\\n\\nThere were also a number of other sessions that were well-attended and extremely interesting, including:\\n\\n- **\'LTI Advantage for System Administrators\'**, a thorough overview from Blackboard\'s own Eric Preston of the history of LTI, the new LTI Advantage spec, and everything a system administrator needs to know about LTI.\\n- **\'A Galaxy of Learn Data - Blast off with BbData & Python!\'** was a look at the amazing work that Mike Bechtel from Indian River State College has done using Python to interact with Blackboard Data.\\n- **\'Turning any resource into an LTI tool to optimize Base Navigation\'** from University of Chicago\'s Szymon Machajewski was an entertaining look at a simple tool that turns any URL into an LTI tool that can be embedded into any LTI-compliant platform.\\n\\nI wish I could list highlights of all of the sessions, but in the spirit of brevity, let me just say thank you. Thank you to all of our presenters for taking the time out of your busy schedule -- sometimes crazy early, crazy late, or both -- to share your knowledge with the rest of our community. There is no better way to support and learn from each other than open communication. I look forward to building on this virtual DevCon to continue that global communication.\\n\\nNext week, we\u2019ll continue running sessions three times each day to accommodate all time zones and schedules. Here are some sessions you won\u2019t want to miss:\\n\\n- The Python and the Postman - REST APIs for Beginners\\n- Migrate Your B2 to LTI Advantage and REST\\n- Models for Learn REST and LTI Integrations\\n- The DevCon Gamification Query: what we built, how we designed it, and how might you adapt it for your institution\\n- GUI Admin Tips and Tricks Unconference Sessions\\n\\nAnd don\u2019t forget about Hackboard: Data. This weeklong event will allow attendees to build meaningful insights against the wealth of information Blackboard Data puts at your fingertips. We\u2019ll kick off Monday and finish on Friday, with two Q&A sessions in between. So add the Hackboard: Data session to your schedule and join us for the kickoff on Monday!\\n\\nAs I write this, it looks like Mark Reynolds is atop the leaderboard, with Bradley Lawton and Eric Silva fast on his heels. And I would be remiss if I didn\'t mention our badging with Badgr. So far (not including Friday), we have awarded 480 badges, including:\\n\\n- Arokia Raj, INTI Internation University and Colleges in Malaysia, who earned the \'Daily Champions Champion\' badge by earning all of the Daily Champion badges.\\n- Mark Carroll, Mark Reynolds, and Kevin Lowey who earned the \'Let\'s take it data day\' badge, by attending 4 of the 8 data-based (see what I did there?) sessions.\\n- Mark Carroll, Alicia Dunlap, Irene Rojas, and Elizabeth Barcena, who have attended more than half of the LTI sessions, earning them the \'LTI Advantageous\' badge.\\n\\nHoping to see all who attended and more back on Monday as we get ready for another week of great content from our clients (and us, too).\\n\\nNow you know, I can\'t let the chance to write some code poetry pass by:\\n\\n> DevCon \u2013 one week down.<br />\\n> Full of tips, tricks, chits and chats.<br />\\n> Earn those badges yet?"}]}')}}]);
