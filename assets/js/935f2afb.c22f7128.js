One of the fundamental requirements for integration partners is to be able to retrieve data out of the query model. There are numerous OData controller methods implemented that can be used to retrieve data. However, the purpose of these methods is to supply the needed data for the web client UI pages. Thus, the design and function of these methods are extremely prescribed. In most cases, when there is a need to retrieve data from Anthology Student, the solution will be to write a custom OData query using the ds/odata endpoint. To maximize the power of this capability, it is important to understand the query data model and specifically, the navigation properties available on each entity in the model. The Data Views feature in the Anthology Student web client is a very powerful tool and can be very helpful in gaining an increased understanding of the query data model. However, one of the limitations in this tool is that many navigation properties for entities are not visible. The only navigation properties that are exposed in the Data Views UI are ones that have a one to one multiplicity with the base entity. Navigation properties that have a one to many multiplicity are hidden from the UI. In order to see a complete inventory of all navigation properties available in the query model, you can use an endpoint that returns the complete metadata for the query model.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"student/best-practices/studentapi-savestudenttransfercredit-details":{"id":"student/best-practices/studentapi-savestudenttransfercredit-details","title":"Using the SaveStudentTransferCredit command API","description":"A common use case for integrators is to persist data for courses completed at other institutions.
