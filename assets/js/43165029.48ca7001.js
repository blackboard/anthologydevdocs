During the 3/22/2016 presentation one of the\nparticipants had questions around setting the minimum and maximum version in\nthe bb-manifest, and setting the B2 version. I've updated the slide deck based\non that conversation and further internal conversations. The slide on B2\nVersioning now states that creating 2 versions of your B2, one for SaaS and\none for 9.1 is bad practice, not second-best. If you write a B2 so that it\nworks in SaaS, it will also work in 9.1 Q2 2016 and future releases of Learn.\nThere is no reason to create two versions. Further discussion on B2 versioning\nand setting the Learn minimum and maximum version # in the bb-manifest follows\nin the comments section below.

With the release of 9.1 Q2 2016 you find that\nyour B2 continues to work without changes, and you find that it meets all of\nthe requirements for deployment in SaaS and works in the current Learn SaaS\nrelease.

This is the best\npractice as it gives you only one version to maintain - and you eliminate any\npossibility of a B2 that doesn't work in SaaS getting installed into a SaaS\nenvironment. Now you need to end-of-life B2 v1 by setting its maximum Learn\nversion in the bb-mainfest to the most recent version of Learn that v1 was\ntested on, assume Q4 2015. With the new v2 B2 you will test, then set, the\nminimum Learn version in the bb-manifest to 3000.x.x (whatever we end up with\nin the GA release). You do not yet set a maximum because you do not know yet\nwhether the v2 B2 will continue to work on future releases of Learn. Because\nLearn SaaS and Learn 9.1 will both have the same Learn version numbering\nscheme rolling forward, starting with this release, the minimum Learn version\nthat you've specified in the bb-manifest correctly specifies the minimum SaaS\nand 9.1 Learn version that the v2 B2 has been tested with."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"A key point of Case 1 is that by architecting your B2 to work in Learn SaaS,\nyou also guarantee that it will work in the Q2 2016 release, provided of\ncourse that if you create and use any custom DB tables you continue to code\nfor MS SQL, and Oracle, as well as Postgres."),(0,a.kt)("h4",{id:"case-2"},"Case 2:"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Blackboard releases a newer version of Learn, say Q2 2017.
