Ex: Admin>Data Integration>Student Information System Integrations>\u2019LIS20 Integration\u2019>Advanced Configuration>Courses>Field Mapping> Source Course Copy Key. Learn only runs this script for LIS 2.0 data feeds. The REST API implementation in Learn doesn\u2019t know about this script that was set for the LIS 2.0 integration.
