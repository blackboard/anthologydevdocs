During the 3/22/2016 presentation one of the\nparticipants had questions around setting the minimum and maximum version in\nthe bb-manifest, and setting the B2 version. I've updated the slide deck based\non that conversation and further internal conversations. The slide on B2\nVersioning now states that creating 2 versions of your B2, one for SaaS and\none for 9.1 is bad practice, not second-best. If you write a B2 so that it\nworks in SaaS, it will also work in 9.1 Q2 2016 and future releases of Learn.\nThere is no reason to create two versions. Further discussion on B2 versioning\nand setting the Learn minimum and maximum version # in the bb-manifest follows\nin the comments section below.

This is the best\npractice as it gives you only one version to maintain - and you eliminate any\npossibility of a B2 that doesn't work in SaaS getting installed into a SaaS\nenvironment. Now you need to end-of-life B2 v1 by setting its maximum Learn\nversion in the bb-mainfest to the most recent version of Learn that v1 was\ntested on, assume Q4 2015. With the new v2 B2 you will test, then set, the\nminimum Learn version in the bb-manifest to 3000.x.x (whatever we end up with\nin the GA release). You do not yet set a maximum because you do not know yet\nwhether the v2 B2 will continue to work on future releases of Learn.
