Every student enrollment period record must be enrolled in a program version. However, in many instances additional areas of study are added which bring additional requirements for the student in order to fully complete and graduate from their enrollment. It is common for students to modify associated areas of study during initial enrollment creation as well as after the enrollment record has been created. This document will cover the details of how to manage associated areas of study to an enrollment record using the available command APIs. Two API endpoints will be referenced in this document. The first is the API that is used to create a new student enrollment period record - api/commands/Academics/StudentEnrollmentPeriod/enrollStudent. The second is an API that can be used to modify the list of associated Areas of Study to an existing student enrollment period record - api/commands/Academics/updateStudentEnrollmentAreaOfStudy.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"student/best-practices/studentapi-paymentpartner-overview":{"id":"student/best-practices/studentapi-paymentpartner-overview","title":"Payment Partner Overview","description":"The Anthology Student API library has a number of APIs that are designed to support the most common use cases for facilitating an integration between a payment provider and the Anthology student application.

Alternative terminology for a payment reversal can be to void the payment, refund the entire payment or refund a portion of the payment that was received. The correct way to handle via the Anthology Student APIs will depend on the specific use case/requirement the integrator needs to achieve. The two APIs that will be covered within this document are api/commands/StudentAccounts/StudentAccountTransaction/voidAccountTransactionPayment and api/student-accounting/ledger-refund-transactions. The voidAccountTransactionPayment API can be used ONLY if the entire payment is being reversed. The ledger-refund-transactions can be used for full or partial payment reversals. Details of using each of these APIs are outlined below.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"student/best-practices/studentapi-postunscheduledpayment-details":{"id":"student/best-practices/studentapi-postunscheduledpayment-details","title":"Post Unscheduled Payments","description":"In order to comply with some of the 90/10 reporting requirements, it may be necessary to ensure that all payments posted to a student\'s ledger card are explicitly associated to a fund source. The main API endpoint used for posting payments provides the option in the request to associate the payment being posted to an expected payment for a packaged student award or post the payment and not associate it to a packaged award. When using the latter option, the payment will be posted to the ledger card and will not be associated to a fund source. This can potentially cause some challenges with providing complete and accurate data for the 90/10 reporting requirements. The API endpoint for posting \\"unscheduled\\" payments can be used to address this issue. The scope of this document will cover the details on how to utilize this API for posting unscheduled payments which ensure that each payment being posted is explicitly associated to a fund source.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"student/best-practices/studentapi-querymodel-metadata":{"id":"student/best-practices/studentapi-querymodel-metadata","title":"Student query model metadata","description":"The student data model is comprised of hundreds and hundreds of entities. One of the fundamental requirements for integration partners is to be able to retrieve data out of the query model. There are numerous OData controller methods implemented that can be used to retrieve data. However, the purpose of these methods is to supply the needed data for the web client UI pages. Thus, the design and function of these methods are extremely prescribed. In most cases, when there is a need to retrieve data from Anthology Student, the solution will be to write a custom OData query using the ds/odata endpoint. To maximize the power of this capability, it is important to understand the query data model and specifically, the navigation properties available on each entity in the model. The Data Views feature in the Anthology Student web client is a very powerful tool and can be very helpful in gaining an increased understanding of the query data model. However, one of the limitations in this tool is that many navigation properties for entities are not visible. The only navigation properties that are exposed in the Data Views UI are ones that have a one to one multiplicity with the base entity. Navigation properties that have a one to many multiplicity are hidden from the UI. In order to see a complete inventory of all navigation properties available in the query model, you can use an endpoint that returns the complete metadata for the query model.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"student/best-practices/studentapi-refundamountvalidation-details":{"id":"student/best-practices/studentapi-refundamountvalidation-details","title":"Refund API Amount Validation","description":"A common use case for integrators is to post a refund transaction to a student\'s ledger card. The refund transaction can be a full payment reversal, a partial refund of a particular payment or a refund due to the student withdrawing from school. A common validation message that is returned when attempting to post this refund is \\"Refund amount cannot exceed #####.##\\". This document will provide the details on the execution logic that is generating this validation message and steps for calculating the maximum amount that is allowed to be refunded from the Anthology Student data model. Understanding this logic will allow for the necessary corrective steps/actions to be taken to properly address the validation message being returned.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"student/best-practices/studentapi-savestudentcoursefuture-details":{"id":"student/best-practices/studentapi-savestudentcoursefuture-details","title":"Add a Future Course for a Student","description":"The StudentCourse entity in the Student data model will hold a record for all courses that a student has completed, is currently taking, is registered for and plans to take in the future. There are instances where there is a need to add a record to this entity for a course that the student plans to take in the future. Other actions that are taken on records in this entity are to register the student for a course, post a final grade for a course, drop a student from a course and unregister a student from a course. The scope of this article will be to provide the details needed for using the API to add a course that the student will take in the future. These other actions that can be performed using this API endpoint will be covered in other articles. Once a future status course is inserted/added to the StudentCourse entity, the action of registering the student for the course can then be taken at the applicable time in the future. NOTE: If the integration use case is to register a student for a course that does not yet exist in the StudentCourse entity for the student, then two API calls will be required. The first will be to add the course in a future status (scope of this document) and the second will be to register the student into the course which will be covered in another document.","sidebar":"documentationSidebar"},"student/best-practices/studentapi-savestudenttransfercredit-details":{"id":"student/best-practices/studentapi-savestudenttransfercredit-details","title":"Using the SaveStudentTransferCredit command API","description":"A common use case for integrators is to persist data for courses completed at other institutions. There is capability in Anthology Student for a student to have course requirements satisfied with course work that has been completed at other institutions. The high level process is for a user to create a student transfer credit record which consists of the course(s) that have been completed at other institutions as well as the internal course(s) that the external course work will be satifying. There are many cases where the process of articulating which external courses satisfy which internal courses is handled outside of the Anthology Student applicatuin boundary. In this case, it is critical to be able to persist this data into Anthology Student so that business processes that have dependencies on transfer credit data will operate as expected. The command API endpoint that is used for persisting this data is api/commands/Admissions/StudentTransferCredit/SaveStudentTransferCredit.

This makes it possible for an institution to perform various actions on groups of students based on the account status values associated.  Many times, the assignment of an account status will be triggered by an action that occurs or a specific data point.  For example, an account status of \\"Delinquent\\" may be associated with a student who has one or more expected installments for a payment plan that have not been received but have a due date in the past.  In many cases, managing the account statuses for students is a key use case that needs to be accomplished within an overall integration project.
