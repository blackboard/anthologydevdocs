A Learn administrator can set up your tool in Learn, following documentation that you provide. Anthology provides documentation applicable to any LTI tool on help.blackboard.com. Rather than reference a link that may change your best bet for finding such documentation is to use your favorite internet search engine and look for \"Learn LTI documentation.\" I just did and the help page for our LTI documentation for admins was the top result! Once your LTI tool has been configured on a Learn system by the admin for that system, course instructors can then place links to your Tool in their courses. Search this site for LTI and you will find demonstrations and tutorials on LTI in Learn. The most common, and likley the best, way for and instructor to place content from your tool in their course is to use Deep-Linking 2.0. The point of this discussion is that once configured by the administrator, use of your tool and the content it provides looks like it is a part of Learn, including when the instructor is selecting content to be 'placed' in the course, and then when the student views and uses that content. And, using the LTI Advantage Names and Roles Provisioning Service (NPRS) and the Assignment and Grades Service (AGS), your tool can integrate closely with the course roster and the gradebook for the course. In summary, you can do a lot with LTI 1.3 & LTI Advantage, where the users of the LMS can use your web-application seamlessly from within the LMS and then with the aforementioned services even manipulate the course roster and gradebook.

Well, the LMS is also a web application and it can be represented by many different types of 'objects'. Users, courses, enrollments, calendars, announcements, content items, assignments, quizes, etc. If you want a complete view of the representation of a user or course member in Learn, you need to use our REST APIs because LTI is written to apply to all platforms, while each platform has it's own nuanced way of representing the different 'objects' in the system. For example a User in Learn has a uuuid identifier, an external ID, a datasource ID, a set of system role IDs, a URL for an avatar, etc. Some other LMS may or may not have these. LTI won't give you everything about a User object in Learn, REST APIs will. LTI may give you a subset. Another thing is that LTI doesn't cover things like creating a document in Learn, or pulling a list of all of the different types of content in a course, or creating, reading and deleting announcements. Here's a short-list of 'objects' you can read and manipulate in Learn with our REST APIs: Announcements, Attendance/meetings, Calendar, content (in the LMS) & attached files, Assessments, Course Categories, Course Groups, Course Memberships (LTI does have Names & Roles, REST give more information about the membership object), Course Messages, Courses, Data Sources, Institutional Hierarchy Nodes, LTI Placements, Course Roles, Institution Roles, System Roles, User Sessions, Terms, Users.

You might build a pure REST Application, but often the easiest way into your application is an LTI Launch from a course or system page on a Learn system.

This is quite convenient for your user as they have a smooth path to using your application (Tool) from Learn. Next, as the user is already logged into Learn, you can behind-the-scenes get an authorization token for making REST API calls back to their Learn system, without having them log in again. (A REST application that doesn't use an LTI launch from Learn will need to ask the user to log into the Learn system they are working with.)
